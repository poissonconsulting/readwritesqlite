Description: Reads and writes data frames to 'SQLite' databases
    while preserving time zones (for POSIXct columns), projections (for
    'sfc' columns), units (for 'units' columns), levels (for factors and
    ordered factors) and classes for logical, Date and 'hms' columns.  It
    also logs changes to tables and provides more informative error
    messages.
