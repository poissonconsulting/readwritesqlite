# readwritesqlite: Enhanced Reading and Writing for 'SQLite' Databases

Reads and writes data frames to 'SQLite' databases while preserving time
zones (for POSIXct columns), projections (for 'sfc' columns), units (for
'units' columns), levels (for factors and ordered factors) and classes
for logical, Date and 'hms' columns. It also logs changes to tables and
provides more informative error messages.
